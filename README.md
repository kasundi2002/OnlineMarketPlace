# OnlineMarketPlace
This is a online shopping platform. 
This is a system that allows small shop owners to create a shop of their own. They can sell their products in this platform. Other users are customers and admin. Customers can register to the platform and login to buy the products they prefer. They can add reviews to the products. They can add them to cart. They can pay through credit/debit card. Admin can manage users, orders, payments and view systems status through the dashboard.
This is implemented using MERN stack.
